### Buildsteps
Publish a create-react-app (CRA) on Github Pages (as user-page) 
Best darn manual in this other Github Repository (Repo): https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages



## Next Steps

**Research ressources**
- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
- https://dev.to
- https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/docs


### First Steps

**Build very simple components**

**Failing or global variables**
Eslint will complain about global variables. If the following will apeace eslint:
`const $ = window.$;`   (exsplicitly tells eslint I want global variable)
..then variable is global (and should be changed).


## Second Steps

**React Bootstrap / React Strap**
The latter being a lightweight version, it should be considered for early implementation
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap

**React Flow seems doable and usefull.**
Flow, like Typescript is a static type chekker. But Flow seems the simplest (is a dependency - not its own prog. lang.)

## Further Steps

**Format staged code automatically for commits with Prettier**

**Develope components in isolation with Storybook**
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/developing-components-in-isolation


**Using HTTPS in Development, fx when working with API serving https**
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/
To do this, set the HTTPS environment variable to true, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:
